title: Rating Scale
description: My rating scale description
---

Here's my rating scale. Number/star ratings are pretty silly and sometimes undermine the points made in the review itself. You're always going to lose something when attaching a quantitative value to something inherently qaulitative like a review. On the otherhand, creating hierarchies or categorizing stuff is a lot of fun.

As a disclaimer, I think I am more interested in talking about games I like, detailing why I enjoyed them rather than getting into games that fall below neutral on this scale. Also, I intend to avoid reviewing a game that I have not finished. All this to say, there will most likely be a glut of highly rated games on this website.

## Description Table

| Star Rating  | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| ★★★★★  | The best of the best, either a perfect game or one I irrationally love despite its flaws  | 
| ★★★★1/2  | Fantastic, my favorite games are 9's if not 10's | 
| ★★★★ | Really good, standouts amongst the rest | 
| ★★★1/2 | I liked it, a solid game  |
| ★★★ | Okay, although I might of thought about not finishing the game once or twice |
| ★★1/2 | neutral |
| ★★ | ehh, either a bland slog or had lows that outweighed any highs |
| ★1/2 | why |
| ★ | big waste of time |
| 1/2 |insultingly bad |
