description: PC game reviews and thoughts

This is a place for an outcast goblin to mess around and develop some coding ability in HTML, Java, CSS, etc. It will also be where the goblin posts poorly written reviews, analyses, and thoughts on PC games and perhaps other media. Please pardon any broken functionality on this website or any broken use of the english langauge, the goblin is neither a coder or writer. The downtrodden goblin is just looking for a creative outlet away from the harsh reality of life in the sewers of an aluminum mill.
