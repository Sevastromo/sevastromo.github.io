![alt text](/images/top10_2021.jpg)

1. **[Project Zomboid](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/03/03/Project-Zomboid-Review.html)** - the ultimate zombie survival sandbox experience.
2. **[Resident Evil 2 Remake](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/03/21/Resident-Evil-2-Remake-Review.html)** - sticks to the strengths of the original Resident Evil trilogy while presenting itself as a beautifully detailed 3rd person survival horror game.
3. **[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat (Gunslinger Mod)](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/03/24/Stalker-COP-Review.html)** - the world and atmosphere of Stalker truly sticks with you. Even though it is singleplayer and I've seen everything thing the campaign/side quests have to offer, I find myself searching for reasons to return to the zone. I'll never forget this game.
4. **Rimworld: Ideology** - an expansion that adds game-changing, thematic variety to each colony. Great for mixing up playthroughs.
5. **[Darkwood](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/04/04/Darkwood-Review.html)** - a true survival horror experience set in a beautifully bleak world.
6. **Resident Evil Village** - an entertaining action-adventure (not a lot of survival, some horror) extravaganza. A fun game, but I'm very unsure about the future of Resident Evil.
7. **Resident Evil 3 Remake** - a fun game, a lackluster remake. This could've been so much more...
8. **Loop Hero** - a fun roguelike with an original set of mechanics.
9. **Fallout 2** - a beautifully grim world fully realized and begging to be explored.
10. **Valheim** - not my cup of tea, but it was fun and I could see myself giving it another shot.

### Best of 2020

![alt text](/images/top10_2020.jpg)

1. **Escape From Tarkov** - the best multiplayer/co-op experience I've ever had. An FPS thats verges on horror. Gun mechanics and handling that I wish were replicated in every realistic shooter I play.
2. **[Battle Brothers: Blazing Deserts](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/08/03/Battle-Brothers-Review-V2.html#blazing-deserts)** - I've already said enough
3. **Hades** - a fun, story-driven roguelike. The greek mythology is really well done with the gods all being memorable. Everything about the game is an 8/10.
4. **Metro Exodus** - this game has grown on me a lot, but maybe its just because I'm remembering the open world sections and not everything else. It also keeps good company in my thoughts, along side the likes of Tarkvo and Stalker.
5. **Slay the Spire: The Watcher** - Unfortunately the most boring character out of the bunch. Fortunately, Slay the Spire is spectacular so their worst is others best.
6. **Halo Master Chief Collection** - a fantastic bundle of the scattered memories I have of the Halo franchise, ranging from multiplayer maps I binged to death with my brothers, campaigns I played through with old friends, and stuff I missed from odd entries long ago.
7. **Monster Train** banger soundtrack, fun gameplay, blegh visuals.
8. **Spelunky 2** - Spelunky is hard.
9. **Rimworld: Royalty** - an okay expansion that I probably didn't fully understand at the time because I was barely scraping the surface of the base content.
10. **Fallout: New Vegas** - a janky classic.

### Best of 2019

![alt text](/images/top10_2019.jpg)

1. **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** - This game sucked me in whole. The meta-progression is my jam. Unlocking new characters and items by taking on various challenges is addicting. I'm not usually one for top-down bullet hell games but this game clicked with me in 2019.
2. **Rimworld** - My pound for pound #1 comes in 2nd to The Binding of Isaac??? Similar to Battle Brothers, Rimworld has grown on me, signficantly. I think games with the much depth can be intimidating and hard to understand the first time around. I think I only played Rimworld 25ish hrs in 2019. That has since changed.
3. **[Battle Brothers](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/08/03/Battle-Brothers-Review-V2.html)** - I have said enough.
4. **Risk of Rain** - awesome soundtrack, simple bought fun gameplay.
5. **Return of the Obra Dinn** - again an awesome and very unique soundtrack, along with an art style I haven't seen before. Has it been long enough to where I have forgotten the solutions to this games' many questions?
6. **Prey** - Have you ever wanted to explore a fully realized, alt-history space station? Well Prey accomplishes that by having visually and functionally distinct sectors of the station, having each human onboard be accounted for and discoverable in-game, and giving the player many tools and applications to interact with the station and its systems.
7. **Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire** - my gold standard for isometric CRPGs.
8. **Risk of Rain 2** - a really cool and accurate transformation of Risk of Rain into 3D.
9. **Stellaris** - cool game, but 4X is not for me.
10. **Noita** - what happens when you mix a fully destructible world with insanely powerful wizardy and a roguelike format... you get a fiendishly chaotic and difficult game.
