1. **[Project Zomboid](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/03/03/Project-Zomboid-Review.html)** - the ultimate zombie survival sandbox experience.
2. **[Resident Evil 2 Remake](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/03/21/Resident-Evil-2-Remake-Review.html)** - sticks to the strengths of the original Resident Evil trilogy while presenting itself as a beautifully detailed 3rd person survival horror game.
3. **[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat (Gunslinger Mod)](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/03/24/Stalker-COP-Review.html)** - the world and atmosphere of Stalker truly sticks with you. Even though it is singleplayer and I've seen everything thing the campaign/side quests have to offer, I find myself searching for reasons to return to the zone. I'll never forget this game.
4. **Rimworld: Ideology** - an expansion that adds game-changing, thematic variety to each colony. Great for mixing up playthroughs.
5. **[Darkwood](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/04/04/Darkwood-Review.html)** - a true survival horror experience set in a beautifully bleak world.
6. **Resident Evil Village** - an entertaining action-adventure (not a lot of survival, some horror) extravaganza. A fun game, but I'm very unsure about the future of Resident Evil.
7. **Resident Evil 3 Remake** - a fun game, a lackluster remake. This could've been so much more...
8. **Loop Hero** - a fun roguelike with an original set of mechanics.
9. **Fallout 2** - a beautifully grim world fully realized and begging to be explored.
10. **Valheim** - not my cup of tea, but it was fun and I could see myself giving it another shot.

1. **Escape From Tarkov** - the best multiplayer/co-op experience I've ever had. An FPS thats verges on horror. Gun mechanics and handling that I wish were replicated in every realistic shooter I play.
2. **[Battle Brothers: Blazing Deserts](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/08/03/Battle-Brothers-Review-V2.html#blazing-deserts)** - I've already said enough
3. **Hades** - a fun, story-driven roguelike. The greek mythology is really well done with the gods all being memorable. Everything about the game is an 8/10.
4. **Metro Exodus** - this game has grown on me a lot, but maybe its just because I'm remembering the open world sections and not everything else. It also keeps good company in my thoughts, along side the likes of Tarkvo and Stalker.
5. **Slay the Spire: The Watcher** - Unfortunately the most boring character out of the bunch. Fortunately, Slay the Spire is spectacular so their worst is others best.
6. **Halo Master Chief Collection** - a fantastic bundle of the scattered memories I have of the Halo franchise, ranging from multiplayer maps I binged to death with my brothers, campaigns I played through with old friends, and stuff I missed from odd entries long ago.
7. **Monster Train** banger soundtrack, fun gameplay, blegh visuals.
8. **Spelunky 2** - Spelunky is hard.
9. **Rimworld: Royalty** - an okay expansion that I probably didn't fully understand at the time because I was barely scraping the surface of the base content.
10. **Fallout: New Vegas** - a janky classic.

![alt text](/images/top10_2019_V2.jpg)

1. **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** - This game sucked me in whole. The meta-progression is my jam. Unlocking new characters and items by taking on various challenges is addicting. I'm not usually one for top-down bullet hell games but this game clicked with me in 2019.
2. **Rimworld** - My pound for pound #1 comes in 2nd to The Binding of Isaac??? Similar to Battle Brothers, Rimworld has grown on me, signficantly. I think games with the much depth can be intimidating and hard to understand the first time around. I think I only played Rimworld 25ish hrs in 2019. That has since changed.
3. **[Battle Brothers](https://sevastromo.github.io/2022/08/03/Battle-Brothers-Review-V2.html)** - I have said enough.
4. **Risk of Rain** - awesome soundtrack, simple bought fun gameplay.
5. **Return of the Obra Dinn** - again an awesome and very unique soundtrack, along with an art style I haven't seen before. Has it been long enough to where I have forgotten the solutions to this games' many questions?
6. **Prey** - Have you ever wanted to explore a fully realized, alt-history space station? Well Prey accomplishes that by having visually and functionally distinct sectors of the station, having each human onboard be accounted for and discoverable in-game, and giving the player many tools and applications to interact with the station and its systems.
7. **Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire** - my gold standard for isometric CRPGs.
8. **Risk of Rain 2** - a really cool and accurate transformation of Risk of Rain into 3D.
9. **Stellaris** - cool game, but 4X is not for me.
10. **Noita** - what happens when you mix a fully destructible world with insanely powerful wizardy and a roguelike format... you get a fiendishly chaotic and difficult game.

1. **Gwent** - beta Gwent, the one and only time I've been invested in a competitive multiplayer game. I'm sad this version of the game no longer exists as nearly everything else on my 2018 list has aged beautifully and I play to this day.
2. **Spelunky** - the only time my wife has enjoyed playing a video game... 
3. **Faster Than Light** - one of the best games I've ever played. Like a great movie, everytime I return to FTL I enjoy it more.
4. **Hitman** - The Paris level is one of the greatest levels in gaming history.
5. **Slay the Spire** - again, one of the best games I've ever played. Endlessly replayable, endlessly fun.
6. **Into the Breach** - the best roguelike/puzzle game out there. I love the art design and soundtrack, the feel is simple yet detailed, sci-fi but rooted on earth.
7. **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons** - sad :(
8. **Dead Space** - the iconic sci-fi horror video game. Shows its age a bit.
9. **Superflight** - the best $3 game.
10. **Darkest Dungeon** - holds the record for the game I've played the most but never beaten.

1. **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** - the best story-driven game I've ever played. The Witcher 3 was such an impactful game for me. I fell in love with standalone Gwent, I trudged through part of Witcher 1, kinda enjoyed Witcher 2, read part of a book (I never read), grimaced through 1.5 seasons of Netflix Witcher when Henry Cavill wasn't on screen all trying to recapture that feeling of being immersed in the world of Witcher 3.
2. **Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain** - along with Hitman, MGSV has the best stealth gameplay. MGSV offers a vast array of tactical options in its sandbox while the story is complete batshit crazy.
3. **Exanima** - I've watched this game slowly grow for the past 5 years and while it is extremely slow in development the groundwork and concept here are truly original and exciting. The combat and movement starts by feeling completely jank and broken but slowly becomes graceful and deep with familiarity.
4. **Resident Evil Remake** - I went from "What the fuck are fixed camera angles?!?! This is unplayable" to "This is peak immersive gameplay". The Spencer Mansion is one of my favorite video game environments.
5. **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl** - this was my introduction to Stalker, I don't know what compelled me to try it, but I'm glad I did.
6. **Thief 2: The Metal Age** - the stealth genre OG
7. **Thief: Gold** - the stealth genre OG prequel
8. **Doom** - very fun game
9. **The Swapper** - cool sci-fi puzzle game
10. **Dishonored** - Thief but with overpowered skills, ehh it's okay.

1. **Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition** - there's been a few games over the course of my life that have changed my perspective on what video games are and can be. Rimworld is an example where the concept of indirectly controlling your colonists through prioirities simply broke my brain for the first couple hours. FTL opened my eyes to the roguelike genre, displaying how repeat playthroughs are part of the game design. Then there's Dark Souls.
2. **Alien Isolation**
3. **Dark Souls 3**
4. **Soma**
5. **Amnesia: The Dark Descent**
6. **Black Mesa**
7. **Fear**
8. **Spec Ops: The Line**
9. **Metro: Last Light**
10. **Gunpoint**
