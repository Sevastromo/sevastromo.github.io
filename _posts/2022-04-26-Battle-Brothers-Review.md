### Foreword

What if I told you that a game without much in the way of animations, where character have no hands or legs, and weapons don’t move has some of the most visceral fatalities of any game? You’d be a little confused and rightfully so. This indie strategy game has accomplished so much in the way of immersion that I had an out of body experience the other day thinking about just this. I broke concentration in the middle of a tight skirmish in Battle Brothers and realized how simplistic every action looked onscreen. From an outsider’s perspective, one can hardly tell if anything is happening. An icon may flash above a character’s head, a character may glide across tiles on the screen like a chess piece but nothing visually extravagant or near realism is displayed. However, to me, the battle felt visceral with each turn feeling so precious, yet I was rushing decisions eager to deal a decisive blow to the enemy’s forces. This game gets you caught up in the heat of battle, literally. As the commander of your forces, you’ll sometimes lose sight of the big picture, the larger implications of a tactical decision will be missed, and you’ll pay for it later. On other occasions, you’ll remain cool and calculated and pull off flawless victories with your men leaving the battlefield with not so much a scratch on them. Overhype Studios, developers of Battle Brothers, have accomplished a great deal with this gripping, low fantasy, turn-based RPG. They have masterfully married beautifully detailed art design with tense, strategic combat with both resting on game progression that pulls you into a huge, procedurally generated continent and connects you with a band of misfits who you grow to call brothers.

### What is Battle Brothers?

Battle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG set in a medieval, dark-fantasy world. You are a mercenary company’s captain tasked with hiring and outfitting mercenaries, deciding where you explore, who you fight, and establishing the company’s goals.

Battle Brothers gameplay has two distinct layers, a strategic world map and a tactical battle map. On the world map the captain manages the company, taking contracts, exploring the wilderness, and overseeing the development of your mercenaries. The game switches to the tactical map when a battle commences. On the tactical map, turn-based combat takes place where the captain has control of the mercenary company’s every move. 

Feature highlights (in my opinion):

* Beautifully detailed artwork that conveys pertinent gameplay information.
* A diverse set of weapons and armor to buy and loot. What gear you equip matters, hammers puncture armor while cleavers cause deep wounds.
* A gripping, turn-based combat system that rewards forethought, patience, and experience.
* Developing a brother is always unique. Each brother has their own background and traits which lead into a classless perk and attribute system.
* A wide range of challenging enemies to test your company’s strength and flexibility against. Defeating legendary locations and overcoming crises’ make for dynamic, end game goals.

### Building a Brother

![alt text](/images/BBbuild.jpg)

In Battle Brothers not all brothers are equal. You’ll quickly begin to realize that the background of the brother you hired has significant implications on the base level and overall potential of that brother. Hiring a vagabond at the local village may be convenient and cheap with his sackcloth outfit and bludgeon but he won’t compare well to the rare, mace-wielding sellsword you saw at the fort to the north. However, a great aspect of this game is that there’s a time and place where either of these hires would make the most sense. The game is dynamic in that shoveling out coin for the baddest bloke on the block is not always the best move. Early in the game, when your mercenary company’s numbers are thin and the purse is tight, hiring a vagabond so that you have another body to throw onto the battlefield makes a lot of sense. Once your company is well established and not with the early game financial restraints, the sellsword could make the most sense by adding a highly skilled, well-equipped brother to your ranks. Below is a comparison of a mediocre sellsword to an exceptional vagabond. This illustrates the cost effectiveness of checking out lowborn backgrounds as the base level attributes are comparable, but the initial cost and wage gap is substantial. The wages in particular are of concern as the initial cost can be somewhat offset by the gear the brother currently possess. If the company needs a strong axe and decent helmet, the cost of the sellsword becomes more appetizing. Wages are a reoccurring cost and will only potentially be offset by the benefits of higher attributes.

![alt text](/images/BBcomp1.jpg)

Understanding a brother’s attributes is key to developing and outfitting them. There are 16 total attributes, 8 of which the player has direct control over through level-ups with the rest being indirectly affected by the brother’s gear, perks, and other attributes. With each level-up, the brother receives the ability to increase 3 attributes a randomly rolled amount. The range of that random amount is determined by the attribute itself as well as the brother’s number of talent stars in that attribute. More talent stars mean a higher average roll. A brother’s background will set a base range for these 8 attributes, for instance a vagabond will most likely roll a low melee skill while a sellsword can roll very high melee skill. However, a vagabond could high roll melee skill and have talent stars in that attribute which at max-level will have them surpassing the sellsword in that attribute. This system makes it so that on average sellswords are going to make the better mercenary but that doesn’t mean you can’t come across an exceptional vagabond and benefit greatly from his lower wages.

This leads into one of Battle Brothers’ strong suits, brother development. When a brother’s services are purchased, the player receives neither a blank slate nor a defined party member (i.e. a tank or damage-dealer), rather a brother that can be molded to fit some natural predispositions and/or what the company needs. The aforementioned leveling system and base attributes support this but the icing on the cake is Battle Brothers’ perk system. Perks in Battle Brothers are one of the best implementations of character progression I’ve seen in video games, it’s diverse and flexible, no pick feels bad or wasteful, and the upgrade to the brother is almost always tangible immediately. Perks are unlocked in tiers alongside level-ups, giving access to 4-7 perks with each increment. With 7 tiers the player will eventually have the opportunity to pick a total of 10 perks from the 7 tiers. The perk progression from low to high tiers does not necessary reflect on their power level but more so the practicality at that stage of the build/game. Low level perks are more flexible in their purpose and usefulness, while high level perks have more specific, strong effects that may not be applicable early in a build. Perk selection reminds me a lot of card selection in Slay the Spire. Nearly every card choice a player sees is an upgrade to Slay the Spire’s base decks, however knowing which cards to pick based on future enemies, what floor you’re on, what relics you have, and what the rest of your deck is composed of is key to surviving in the Spire. Context matters, and that holds true in Battle Brothers. Perk choices feel impactful because each brother is an important cog in the mercenary company and that perk is part of the puzzle that decides what your brother is going to be long term. The player has to counterbalance the immediate needs of the company versus long-term company composition versus what’s best for the brother. All these considerations make brother progression a fun, strategic mechanic that never grows stale because no two brothers or companies are ever alike.

Below are examples of fully progressed brothers that illustrates some of the previous points. Firstly, these brothers come from very different backgrounds, one is a sellsword, the other a farmhand. Their attributes however are quite comparable. Both are fit, being able to adorn the heaviest of armor sets while still having plenty of stamina to carry and swing heavy weapons. With large pools of HP and resolve, they are able to withstand physical and psychological attacks while avoiding injury. Coupled with high melee defense, these brothers can stand in the fray without a shield unphased by enemy attacks.

The brothers’ specific traits are where they begin to diverge and become more unique. The sellsword has the dexterous trait giving him a bonus to melee skill. Without talent stars in this attribute, it would’ve been difficult for him to become this skilled otherwise. With a high melee skill of 98, I outfitted the sellsword with the highest single-swing damage weapon possible, a famed two-handed axe. This meant I could nearly guarantee massive damage to a single enemy target every turn. For added flexibility the sellsword carries a long axe on his back and has both the pathfinder and quick hands perks, meaning repositioning and switching weapons is often an option. This sellsword has been an unmitigated success, racking in 728 kills in 306 battles making him one of the deadliest and prolific brothers I’ve built.

The farmhand has the iron lungs perk giving him extra stamina recovery per turn. Considering this, I outfitted him with the highest damage multi-swing weapon, a famed orc cleaver. Typically weapons that you can swing multiple times per turn become problematic as the battle wears on, brothers can only a swing so many times before running out of stamina. The iron lungs plus the farmhand’s high base fatigue means he can go longer in battle before running of stamina. For flexibility and reach, the farmhand also has a whip. This provides very good utility as the farmhand can disarm dangerous opponents from a distance or stack bleeds, a damage over time status effect. This farmhand started with the company latter and endured some injury issues, yet 276 kills in 179 battles shows this brother is very effective with the lower kill rate partially being attributed to whip disarm usage.

### Building a Mercenary Company

![alt text](/images/BBcompany.jfif)

In Battle Brothers not all mercenary companies are created equal. You’ll quickly begin to realize that the origin of the campaign you select has significant implications on the base level and overall potential of that company. The first option you are presented with when starting a new campaign is the company’s origin. Origins range anywhere from being a group of caravanners to being a lone hedge knight. These origins provide substantial gameplay impact particularly early in the campaign. Each origin comes with a unique set of starting brothers, equipment, resources, and most importantly special rules. These special rules typically come in the form of campaign-long buffs and/or debuffs. For example, if you were to select the _Northern Raiders_ origin you would start with three battle-hardened barbarians that are experienced pillagers and would therefore have a higher chance of finding items after battle; however, they would also have poor relations with most of the noble factions. Overall, the origin mechanic provides fun and interesting variability between campaigns making each company feel distinct both mechanically and thematically.

### The Battlefield

I think we’ve tiptoed around the main course long enough so let’s get into the Battle Brothers combat system. At a very basic level, Battle Brothers has turn-based combat that takes place on a hex-tiled grid. Each turn a unit is limited to a set number of action points (AP), AP is used when moving, using weapon skills, or perk skills. The turn order is dependent upon the initiative of units. The hex-tiled grid comes with elevation, terrain types, obstacles, and zones of control exhibited by units.
The AP system is very standard and serves its purpose well. One aspect of note is that AP cost for movement is integrated with terrain types. Therefore, moving through a swamp or up a hill is not only fatigue intensive but also limits overall distance traveled. This is important to note as terrain can severely impact battle strategies. When fighting on flat grass a brother can usually move 2 tiles and then swing a one-handed weapon; however, this does not hold true in a swamp. Battles in swamps or on hills take on a different feel, they’re slower with brothers running out of stamina quicker and leaving you feeling exposed. Personally, I try avoiding swamp fights altogether but it’s not like I don’t want that terrain in the game. I like that there’s a diverse set of terrains, some scarier to fight on then others. It gives a true character to the landscape.
Another fun aspect I hinted at is tile elevation. Tiles with elevation cost extra fatigue and AP to reach, but once there give a buff to hit chance and a debuff to enemy hit chance. Let’s just say, attacking an enemy fortification on a hill is rough, as it should. Your men get drained of stamina while the enemy picks them apart, it’s a dangerous situation that must be navigated carefully. Then there’s obstacles. Obstacles are not thought of much until they are. The terrain where this matters the most is forest and holy shit do I never want to be ambushed by goblins in the forest ever again, fuck those fights. I love it but I hate it, the ambush scrambles your men and the trees (obstacles) split them apart. Combined with the high AP cost to move on forest terrain, repositioning and forming any semblance of a formation is out of the question. On top of the that some obstacles, trees for one, block sight, so you have limited knowledge of the enemy, resulting in goblins darting in and out of the company’s sight lines. The compounding effect is that goblin forest ambushes suck and they’re very dangerous for your men. The combination of the terrain, elevation, and obstacles make each battlefield unique making what could have been a routine mop up of a goblin patrol into a frantic scramble to mitigate causalities.
An important question to ask in any turn-based strategy game is how does the turn order work? More specifically, are there any other game mechanics that it interacts with, or can the player manipulate it? In Battle Brothers there is a web of decisions, attributes, and gear that influence turn order. The player has some control in battle, but enemies are also influenced by some of the same factors making turn order hard to predict with utmost certainty. The web all ties back into the initiative attribute, a stat that can be leveled on each of your brothers but is more importantly influenced by the fatigue attribute. This connection makes the initiative stat dynamic in battle and significantly impacted by your choice of equipment out of battle. These ties all make realistic sense too. Brothers who wear heavier armor and wield heftier weapons will be slow to act as their maximum fatigue and therefore initiative will be lowered. As the battle progresses brothers that use multiple fatigue-consuming actions per turn will take initiative penalties sooner as their fatigue increases faster. Using certain perks or using the wait function (allows the brother to temporarily pass their turn at the cost of an initiative penalty) gives the player a few options for turn order manipulation. All these factors plus the stage of the battle are important considerations because it is not always advantageous to go first. Battle Brothers has one of the best turn order systems that I’ve seen in a turn-based strategy game. It seamlessly integrates your brothers’ attributes and gear with turn order while providing some manipulation with perks and the option to wait.

### The Expansions

With each Battle Brothers expansion, the developers have taken the opportunity to add significant variety to the base content present in the game. Everything from weapons and armor to contracts and events has been added to with each update. Added variety in these areas gives the player more options when building brothers and gives the company a wider range of things to do. This makes each campaign unique, giving Battle Brothers serious replay value. With that being said, in the following sections I will focus primarily on the unique features added by the particular expansions.

---

#### Beasts and Exploration

![alt text](/images/BBbeasts.jfif)

Beasts and Exploration expands upon the realms outside the civilized world adding more variety and depth to the encounters found out in the wilderness. While roaming from town to town taking on contracts, there are certain comforts that make those interactions and outcomes more known and controllable. When in the lands of noble houses there’s always a relative ease of access to resources, new recruits, and services (e.g., temples that heal injuries) meaning less consideration needs to be given each time the company sets out on the road. This contrasts with the planning that must be done when venturing into the wilderness. I appreciate this strategic variety that can be engaged with at the company’s discretion. If you decide to make an excursion into the wilds, you must be able to stockpile resources for the trip. For example, you must ensure can feed and pay your mercenaries for the duration otherwise morale will drop. The health and numbers of brothers in your service must be considered as you don’t want to get ambushed with injured brothers in your frontlines. Lastly, to make the trip a profitable venture, it is best to minimize the number of items in your inventory, maximizing the amount of loot you can return with in tow. While this expansion didn’t necessarily create this gameplay option, it heavily incentivized it in a new way by adding unique encounters and loot that can be found in the wilds. Hidden legendary locations now dot the map offering interesting interactions and rewards while new beasts populate the land presenting new challenges in combat. While I still feel humanoid enemies are more fun and rewarding to battle, the addition of beast trophies and a fairly minimal crafting system helps swing the balance a touch. Thematically, I love the crafting system. Killing a pack of direwolves will yield a few pelts and by taking said pelts to a taxidermist you can receive a direwolf mantle. So just after slaughtering these wolves you can then go to the brother who led the assault and mount the mantle on his back, increasing his armor durability and making him more fearsome in combat by debuffing adjacent opponents resolve. Battle Brothers does stuff like this really well, reinforcing decisions you make on the battlefield by carrying over the effects. In the next battle your one brother may stand tall with his direwolf mantle terrorizing the enemy, a reminder of the victory over that pack of direwolves. However, it is just as likely you have a brother on the other flank struggling to breath because in the same direwolf fight he was mauled, permanently losing his nose in the process. It was your tactical decision that put him in danger and now the results of that decision have trickled into the next battle.

Getting back to the expansion, I certainly think Beasts and Exploration is worth purchasing. The added variety described above goes a long way. It mixes up the feel of the landscape by creating a more distinct yet still geographically blurred line between the “civilized” world and the wilderness. By expanding the wilderness, a vastness is achieved where poor planning and management of your company can result in an unfruitful expedition, or worse yet, your company's last days.

#### Warriors of the North

![alt text](/images/BBwotn2.jpg)

The Warriors of the North expansion features two fantastic additions to the core Battle Brothers experience. The first addition I’ve already touched on in the beginning of the _Building a Mercenary Company_ section and that is company origins. To quickly reiterate my thoughts, the addition of company origins was an excellent decision by the developers to incentivize multiple playthroughs. This was done by promoting different playstyles through campaign long buffs/debuffs and thematic starting brothers which possess differing skill sets and equipment. Before this you could make an effort to roleplay a particular type of company, but with origins being the _Peasant Militia_ or a _Lone Wolf_ feels very distinct. As the militia you’re forced into a ragtag group of exclusively low-born backgrounds, so a bunch of farmhands, daytalers, millers, etc. With the plus-side being you can field 16 on the battlefield at the same, up from the normal limit of 12. On the other end of the spectrum, there’s the lone wolf origin where you start with a single hedge knight armed with heavy armor and a greatsword. While this one brother is very strong and well geared, he’s vastly outnumbered on the battlefield. So, with a handful of other origins to select from, starting a campaign always feels fresh and immediately distinct from the last.

The other notable addition is the new faction, northern barbarians. On the strategic world map barbarians are not too dissimilar from the standard brigands. Barbarians roam the northern tundra and snow-covered mountain ranges raiding and pillaging and have encampments out in the wilderness. In battle the barbarian’s standout and these skirmishes have become my favorite in the game. Through the ranks, barbarians wield a variety of crude weapons everything from a moose antler to a spiked skull mace. These weapons test the robustness of your brothers with their high armor ignore stats, meaning a fully armored brother is still at risk of receiving a crippling injury from an armor piercing blow. Standing and trading blows with barbarians is not a recommended tactic for this reason. Barbarian armor sports pelts and horns on top of rusty chain mail and bulky metal plates giving them a weighty, ritualistic aesthetic. Lastly, the snowy battlegrounds combined with the new soundtracks give skirmishes with barbarians an epic atmosphere. The guttural groans paced by the battle-trance inducing war drums highlight that you are in a foreign land, unwelcoming to unprepared outsiders. Check out a sample below.

Warriors of the North is a worthy addition to the Battle Brothers base game. The added variety in campaign starts and enemy factions contributes to an already expansive world and set of gameplay options.

#### Blazing Deserts

![alt text](/images/BBdesert.jfif)

While the previous two expansions added to a few aspects of the base game, the Blazing Deserts expansion impacted nearly all aspects while also adding in a couple new gameplay mechanics. Blazing Deserts is undoubtedly the biggest Battle Brothers expansion so far and with its theme built around middle eastern culture it is clear the game world is expanding south.

Blazing Deserts is centered around new lands to the south, meaning through exploration there’s new factions and beasts to fight and new locations to discover. Unlike the north, the south is home to independent city-states which thrive in the middle of the desert. Geographically, the city-states can be easy to access via a port or what I’ve found more often is that they’re very remote. The desert is an expansive portion of the bottom of the world map and these cities can be dotted across it from the far east to the far west. I like that these hubs are geographically distinct from the clustered northern cities and villages. Making the decision to go south feels like a weighty one, almost like committing to a venture into wilds just with a few checkpoints along the way. For an example check out the city-state of _Azim Shab_ on the world map in the earlier section. I remember one trip I made out to _Azim Shab_ where I had stockpiled trade goods from the north in hopes to turn a profit and then hire a highly skilled brother like an assassin, gladiator, or nomad. When I arrived after days on the desert road, the recruits available were all indebted slaves and a few low-borns, the disappointment was immense. I traded in my wares, bought a few potions at the alchemist but felt overall that the trip was a waste of precious company time and resources. Moving forward I knew I had to think more carefully before traveling out to _Azim Shab_, maybe taking a caravan job out that way could offset the cost of a future trip.

One feature that can offset the cost of travel is actually also a new game mechanic and a very fun one at that. Turns out, these city-states are not only centers for trade and commerce but also are home to the gladiator arena. A new building that offers an arena contract, where a couple of your brothers can compete in gladiator combat to entertain the masses. Success in the arena can earn the company coin and unique gladiator armor, but also battle-hardened your brothers earning them arena related traits. The arena standouts because it offers a twist on the normal structure of combat in Battle Brothers. It is a more limited yet higher stakes format, where only three of your brothers may enter but none may leave unless victorious. Combat in the arena feels stripped down, there’s no terrain or elevation concerns, you know the enemy ahead of time, and with only 3 brothers weapon choice becomes critical. The impact of every attack that connects is amplified in importance as one unlucky blow to the head could turn the tides of the fight. I don’t know how flexible the Battle Brothers turn-based combat system is, but 3 vs 3 feels right at the lower end of what would be enjoyable and tactical. In contrast to the 12 vs 45 goblins on a hill fights, the arena is so much more fun and bite-sized.

The city-states are also home to the city-state forces, a formidable faction well-equipped like the northern noble armies only utilizing very different tactics in battle. And that is a very strong theme throughout the opponents added in this expansion. The city-state forces utilize guns and mortars to destroy armor and shellshock your brothers from range while assassins creep around your flanks hurling grenades and dancing away from your attacks. The nomads in the desert are agile, able to dodge your attacks, and use cheap tactics like throwing sand in your eyes. Beasts in the desert like the hyena jump on your men before you know it causing a bleeding status effect, while serpents can wrap a brother up and drag him behind enemy lines, surrounding him in the process One blemish is the ifrit encounters. They’re a sentient rock entity that when struck crumples into multiple smaller forms of itself. These fights are an absolute slog and provide little in the way of interesting decision making or tactics. They wouldn’t be so much of a problem if it didn’t seem like every day each city-state has a contract to go kill 30 of things, but they do. All in all, the added enemy variety in the south is great with the new tactics being the icing on the cake.

I’ll quick-fire a few more remarks before closing since there’s so much to this expansion.
*	The new holy war crisis is super hard when fighting the city-state forces, holy shit. Awesome that another late game crisis was added.
*	The new gladiator origin is very cool, having high paid but very high skilled brothers is an interesting challenge.
*	All the new gear stemming from the middle eastern theme is beautiful.
*	The retinue, a new feature where the company has non-combat followers, is a nice addition that adds some more customizability to your campaign.

To wrap up, Blazing Deserts is an impressive expansion that touches nearly all aspects Battle Brothers. While not necessary to the core experience and for beginners might be a little much to bite off in one go, I’d recommend it to anyone looking for more Battle Brothers or someone who simply wants the complete experience.

### Verdict

_Have a character (game) with three times three talent stars - "We need real talent to bolster our ranks further. We'll recruit the most talented we can find and mold him into a god of war!"_

★★★★1/2
