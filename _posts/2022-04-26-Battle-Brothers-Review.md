### Foreword

What if I told you that a game without much in the way of animations, where character have no hands or legs, and weapons don’t move has some of the most visceral fatalities of any game? You’d be a little confused and rightfully so. This indie strategy game has accomplished so much in the way of immersion that I had an out of body experience the other day thinking about just this. I broke concentration in the middle of a tight skirmish in Battle Brothers and realized how simplistic every action looked onscreen. From an outsider’s perspective, one can hardly tell if anything is happening. An icon may flash above a character’s head, a character may glide across tiles on the screen like a chess piece but nothing visually extravagant or near realism is displayed. However, to me, the battle felt visceral with each turn feeling so precious, yet I was rushing decisions eager to deal a decisive blow to the enemy’s forces. This game gets you caught up in the heat of battle, literally. As the commander of your forces, you’ll sometimes lose sight of the big picture, the larger implications of a tactical decision will be missed, and you’ll pay for it later. On other occasions, you’ll remain cool and calculated and pull off flawless victories with your men leaving the battlefield with not so much a scratch on them. Overhype Studios, developers of Battle Brothers, have accomplished a great deal with this gripping, low fantasy, turn-based RPG. They have masterfully married beautifully detailed art design with tense, strategic combat with both resting on game progression that pulls you into a huge, procedurally generated continent and connects you with a band of misfits who you grow to call brothers.

### Building a Brother

![alt text](/images/BBbuild.jpg)

In Battle Brothers not all brothers are equal. You’ll quickly begin to realize that the background of the brother you hired has significant implications on the base level and overall potential of that brother. Hiring a vagabond at the local village may be convenient and cheap with his sackcloth outfit and bludgeon but he won’t compare well to the rare, mace-wielding sellsword you saw at the fort to the north. However, a great aspect of this game is that there’s a time and place where either of these hires would make the most sense. The game is dynamic in that shoveling out coin for the baddest bloke on the block is not always the best move. Early in the game, when your mercenary company’s numbers are thin and the purse is tight, hiring a vagabond so that you have another body to throw onto the battlefield makes a lot of sense. Once your company is well established and not with the early game financial restraints, the sellsword could make the most sense by adding a highly skilled, well-equipped brother to your ranks. Below is a comparison of a mediocre sellsword to an exceptional vagabond. This illustrates the cost effectiveness of checking out lowborn backgrounds as the base level attributes are comparable, but the initial cost and wage gap is substantial. The wages in particular are of concern as the initial cost can be somewhat offset by the gear the brother currently possess. If the company needs a strong axe and decent helmet, the cost of the sellsword becomes more appetizing. Wages are a reoccurring cost and will only potentially be offset by the benefits of higher attributes.

Understanding a brother’s attributes is key to developing and outfitting them. There are 16 total attributes, 8 of which the player has direct control over through level-ups with the rest being indirectly affected by the brother’s gear, perks, and other attributes. With each level-up, the brother receives the ability to increase 3 attributes a randomly rolled amount. The range of that random amount is determined by the attribute itself as well as the brother’s number of talent stars in that attribute. More talent stars mean a higher average roll. A brother’s background will set a base range for these 8 attributes, for instance a vagabond will most likely roll a low melee skill while a sellsword can roll very high melee skill. However, a vagabond could high roll melee skill and have talent stars in that attribute which at max-level will have them surpassing the sellsword in that attribute. This system makes it so that on average sellswords are going to make the better mercenary but that doesn’t mean you can’t come across an exceptional vagabond and benefit greatly from his lower wages.

This leads into one of Battle Brothers’ strong suits, brother development. When a brother’s services are purchased, the player receives neither a blank slate nor a defined party member (i.e. a tank or damage-dealer), rather a brother that can be molded to fit some natural predispositions and/or what the company needs. The aforementioned leveling system and base attributes support this but the icing on the cake is Battle Brothers’ perk system. Perks in Battle Brothers are one of the best implementations of character progression I’ve seen in video games, it’s diverse and flexible, no pick feels bad or wasteful, and the upgrade to the brother is almost always tangible immediately. Perks are unlocked in tiers alongside level-ups, giving access to 4-7 perks with each increment. With 7 tiers the player will eventually have the opportunity to pick a total of 10 perks from the 7 tiers. The perk progression from low to high tiers does not necessary reflect on their power level but more so the practicality at that stage of the build/game. Low level perks are more flexible in their purpose and usefulness, while high level perks have more specific, strong effects that may not be applicable early in a build. Perk selection reminds me a lot of card selection in Slay the Spire. Nearly every card choice a player sees is an upgrade to Slay the Spire’s base decks, however knowing which cards to pick based on future enemies, what floor you’re on, what relics you have, and what the rest of your deck is composed of is key to surviving in the Spire. Context matters, and that holds true in Battle Brothers. Perk choices feel impactful because each brother is an important cog in the mercenary company and that perk is part of the puzzle that decides what your brother is going to be long term. The player has to counterbalance the immediate needs of the company versus long-term company composition versus what’s best for the brother. All these considerations make brother progression a fun, strategic mechanic that never grows stale because no two brothers or companies are ever alike.

Below are examples of fully progressed brothers that illustrates some of the previous points. Firstly, these brothers come from very different backgrounds, one is a sellsword, the other a farmhand. Their attributes however are quite comparable. Both are fit, being able to adorn the heaviest of armor sets while still having plenty of stamina to carry and swing heavy weapons. With large pools of HP and resolve, they are able to withstand physical and psychological attacks while avoiding injury. Coupled with high melee defense, these brothers can stand in the fray without a shield unphased by enemy attacks.

The brothers’ specific traits are where they begin to diverge and become more unique. The sellsword has the dexterous trait giving him a bonus to melee skill. Without talent stars in this attribute, it would’ve been difficult for him to become this skilled otherwise. With a high melee skill of 98, I outfitted the sellsword with the highest single-swing damage weapon possible, a famed two-handed axe. This meant I could nearly guarantee massive damage to a single enemy target every turn. For added flexibility the sellsword carries a long axe on his back and has both the pathfinder and quick hands perks, meaning repositioning and switching weapons is often an option. This sellsword has been an unmitigated success, racking in 728 kills in 306 battles makes this sellsword one of the deadliest and prolific brothers I’ve built.

The farmhand has the iron lungs perk giving him extra stamina recovery per turn. Considering this, I outfitted him with the highest damage multi-swing weapon, a famed orc cleaver. Typically weapons that you can swing multiple times per turn become problematic as the battle wears on, brothers can only a swing so many times before running out of stamina. The iron lungs plus the farmhand’s high base fatigue means he can go longer in battle before running of stamina. For flexibility and reach, the farmhand also has a whip. This provides very good utility as the farmhand can disarm dangerous opponents from a distance or stack bleeds, a damage over time status effect. This farmhand started with the company latter and endured some injury issues, yet 276 kills in 179 battles shows this brother is very effective with the lower kill rate partially being attributed to whip disarm usage.

### The Expansions

With each Battle Brothers expansion, the developers have taken the opportunity to add significant variety to the base content present in the game. Everything from weapons and armor to contracts and events has been added to with each update. Added variety in these areas gives the player more options when building brothers and gives the company a wider range of things to do. This makes each campaign unique, giving Battle Brothers serious replay value. With that being said, in the following sections I will focus primarily on the unique features added by the particular expansions.

### Verdict

_Have a character (game) with three times three talent stars - "We need real talent to bolster our ranks further. We'll recruit the most talented we can find and mold him into a god of war!"_

★★★★1/2
