### Comparisons to a Classic

Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil Remake are my favorite Resident Evil games. It’s tough to separate the two for me. REmake represents the pinnacle of what the original trilogy was: fixed camera angles, beautifully detailed 2D backgrounds and 3D character models, memorable level design, a mix of true horror and shlocky action, restricted inventory space, puzzle solving, and tough combat with a limited arsenal. RE2R picks up on everything REmake accomplished aside from the fixed camera angles and 2D backgrounds. The fixed camera angles are replaced with a more modern 3rd person view and the world is now rendered fully in 3D without compromising on any detail thanks to modern hardware. So, while I’ll miss the original’s fixed camera angles and 2D backgrounds, the only detail lost is those choice camera angles that either hid information intentionally from the player or were just stunningly beautiful. The image on the left is REmake, an obviously curated camera angle that utilizes the foreground while providing a detailed backdrop with its own sources of light and relfections. On the right I took a stab at creating a "fixed camera angle" with the free cam mod. While it is a amatuer attempt, it does illustrate that thanks to modern hardware we can get 2D background level of detail in a 3D environment.

### Oh wow man...

The visuals of RE2R are truly spectacular. The Racoon City Police Department in particular is such a memorable location. Whoever had the idea of the setting to be a police department setup inside an old art museum was a genius. The location is dripping with character. Each room has sort of three layers of personality, an old museum underneath, a police department set inside, and a zombie outbreak on top. This layering gives weight and a history to the location that the player can feel as they move through the halls. It also helps that the connection between the player and the protagonists Leon and Claire is as strong as ever. The in-game models of Leon and Claire are rendered in great detail and all their animations are realistic and responsive. I love the lengths the developers took to add small details to the character animations, such as pinning the flashlight between the neck and shoulder when reloading a gun. The visual design choices also have mechanical weight as the player can just glance at the character model a know what items they have equipped. Below, you can see Claire is in a tough spot but I can also quickly spot she has a stun grenade equipped on her belt. This all leads to to a very cohesive yet detailed visual aesthetic where the storytelling, gameplay, and atmosphere all feed the visual design.

### It Just Works

In terms of gameplay, RE2R does not deviate far from REmake outside of the perspective shift. Hardcore difficulty in particular has that REmake feel with its ink ribbon/typewriter save system and more restrictive inventory size. I’d recommend hardcore to most people, especially those looking for a classic Resident Evil experience. Inventory management has always been the real puzzle in Resident Evil games and that is back in RE2R along with plenty of in-world puzzles. No real brain busters but plenty that make you think for a bit. The pace of combat is also similar to REmake with each zombie posing a threat, especially early on. Leon and Claire aren’t exactly gunslingers and have to take their time to aim their weapon. Zombies are slow, but they’re odd cadence and erratic movement mean they’re not the easiest targets. Even when you do connect on a shot, Zombies and other enemies do not drop easily. Often it will feel like you have to put a whole, precious clip into a lone zombie. This coupled with limited ammunition means picking your battles is important. 

Character progression is primarily done by discovering items which increase the players options and firepower. A thing I love in video games is when a game ties its progression to actual in-game items while making thematic sense and fitting into the environment you're currently in. RE2R nails this for the most part with all the major item upgrades being found in unique, logical location. The shotgun is locked up in the locker room, the matilda stock is in the trunk of a police car, etc. These cool, realistics details being juxtaposed by finding potted herbs that magically heal you in every nook and cranny of Raccoon City make Resident Evil what it is, a quirky mix of immersive survival horror and schlocky action. RE2R leans heavily in the survival horror direction and I'm grateful for it.

The most praise I can give is shown below. Disclaimer, I am not a speedrunner but yes I did speedrun the game as both Leon and Claire and yes it was really fun. This shows that the gameplay system can work in a methodical, survival horror playthrough and a fast-paced action-oriented speedrun.

### Verdict

_“You Want S.T.A.R.S.? I’ll Give You S.T.A.R.S.! ... 4 1/2 of them”_ - Jill Valentine

★★★★1/2

Resident Evil 2 Remake is not ground-breaking, but it does accomplish being a faithful remake. RE2R sticks to the strengths of the original Resident Evil trilogy while presenting itself as a beautifully detailed 3rd person survival horror game.
