## Top 10 Games Played in 2022

<!---

### 1. Doom Eternal

#### Verdict: 
Doom Eternal is the best action FPS I’ve ever played, hands down. No other game has ever had me glued to the screen so intensely. Other games have drawn me in just as much but the pace at which Eternal operates leaves your eyelids completely peeled back and your eyeballs popping out, scraping across the screen trying to take in all the information presented. Seriously, it’s hard to describe the sensory experience the occurs during an Eternal arena fight, there’s nothing quite like it. And it really comes down to the layered strategic options: resource management, enemy weaknesses, navigating the arenas, weapon combos. So, while you’re trying to take in all the visual queues on screen, audio queues are also going off in the background, add on top of that your brain frantically trying to make the right decision or more likely scrambling to correct the mistake you just made. And while I’ve spent so much time gushing over the gameplay, I’ll quickly mention that everything else about Eternal is just top notch. The art and world design are just gorgeous and imaginative, soundtrack and sound design are mixed just right to convey information while revving up the intensity, and the performance is phenomenal. Id Software absolutely optimized the hell out of Eternal and what game could possibly benefit from that more?

#### Why is Doom Eternal #1?
While I may have put way more time into the likes of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Elden Ring, and Hitman 3, Eternal was the first time I've experienced anything like it. I'll remember Eternal like I remember my first time playing a Souls game or a roguelike, it's not just the great gameplay, it's also the sensation of being in uncharted waters.

### 2. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly

#### Verdict: 

#### Why is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly #2?
With S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it's all about the atmosphere and immersion and Anomaly doesn't change that. Anomaly is a modern marvel, a mod the upgrades the game engine and combines three cult classic games into one. No one needs an excuse to reenter the zone, but Anomaly is the perfect one.

### 8. Inside

![alt text](/images/2022-Annual-Recap/IN_titlecard.jpg)

Inside exists in a realm somewhere between games and film. When Inside presents the player with obstacles it slows down and the feel is very gamey. Whether that’s because there’s trail and error involved, and you’re repeatedly dying or because there’s a puzzle that you must resolve before proceeding. None of this is bad just average. I think Inside’s strength is when it flows like a scene in a film that’s shot in a single take. The Sam Mendes’ film 1917 came to mind. Not because of the setting but because of this flow. The camera goes on a journey with the main character as he traverses battlefields, countrysides, cities, and more. There’s a momentum and energy that this technique evokes that can be found throughout Inside. With video games that energy can be even more tactile as you can really engage with the aforementioned _little things_. Brushing aside cornstalks, sliding down roofs, careening through office complexes shattering windows and upturning all furniture in your path… it’s never felt more engaging.

#### Why is Inside #8?

Inside is great… for what it is, some sort of interactive short film. The complete lack of interesting decision-making makes the #8 position quite the feat.

### 9. Quake

#### Verdict: 

I love when old games get quality-of-life updates making them readily playable on new PCs. It’s a bonus when the visuals are upgraded too, especially when the original visual style remains preserved. Quake Enhanced is a perfect example of just this. I remember trying out Quake quite some time ago and bouncing off it and for what reason, I’m not sure, it might have been the low resolution or controls. Now, I could have looked around and found mods to fix these issues as I’m sure they exist, but at the time I just wasn’t motivated. That’s why I like these updates, they remove barriers to entry and give me more reasons to try out classic games.

So, with all that being said, after playing through Quake in its entirety, I like it! It’s clearly a pioneer of the FPS genre. Quake feels like you’re playing through a proof of concept for the entire FPS genre. Everything about the game feels like the core of what’s to come in one of gaming’s major genres. Where Doom and Wolfenstein felt like a first stabs into the unknown, Quake feels like Id Software firmly planting their flag in new ground. I attribute this primarily to the movement and level design. The addition of jumping and full mouse look really fleshes out the groundwork Doom laid in regards to movement. And in parallel the level design was allowed to flourish thanks to these advancements. There’s more variety now with weaving levels of verticality, deep pools to swim through, and ramparts to leap across. It feels very liberating when playing in quick succession after Doom.

Quake is a fun, quick, singleplayer FPS experience that is baked in historical significance. The recent enhanced update only makes it easier for newcomers to enjoy it.

#### Why is Quake #9?

You shoot things and it’s fun.

### 10. Vampire Survivors

![alt text](/images/2022-Annual-Recap/VS_titlecard.jpg)

#### Verdict: 

So, I played Diablo 2 earlier this year and found it very bland in terms of gameplay, the world, characters, music are what drew me in and kept me around for a little bit. The gameplay is so boring that I assume I must be missing something because Diablo 2 is considered a classic pretty much universally. I found it mechanically repetitive, you just smash the attack button and walk around, and on top of that there’s pretty much zero interesting decisions to make during the gameplay loop. Bottomline is I want to like Diablo 2 but I don’t get it. 

Ok, but what does this have to do with Vampire Survivors? Well in Survivors you do even less mechanically speaking. Everything expect movement is stripped away and yet I recommend it? Let me be clear, I’m still unsure if I actually, fully enjoy Survivors, but I can’t deny I’ve played a good number of runs. I think what separates Survivors from Diablo 2 is the bite-sized nature of its content. Runs are 30 min or less which means the one interesting decision-making opportunity present in the game, level-ups, come at a rapid pace.

I’m very on the fence about Vampire Survivors and doubt I’ll want to play it again or any games of its kind. With that being said, I really like all the quality-of-life features, informational menus, selection screens, pretty much the whole user experience. It's very streamlined and fits well with a laid-back game of this nature.

#### Why is Vampire Survivors #10?

Vampire Survivors, much like Inside, although in very different ways, leaves me scratching my head as to whether or not it fully constitutes what a game is. It makes the list because it’s simple and fun, but only if I don’t think about it too much.
