### A New Survival Horror

As much as I love Resident Evil games, especially the classics, Darkwood better exemplifies the genre Resident Evil invented, survival horror. This is the best game I have played that melds survival mechanics with horror. The survival mechanics involve light crafting, base defense, weapon durability and repair, scavenging, limited inventory, and a brutal day-night cycle. I’m not the biggest “open-world survival” game fan, but these elements are done intuitively and never feel like artificial gatekeeping. In-game items are found, built, and repaired in a grounded, real-world manner that gives a genuine sense of scarcity and vulnerability to the player. The house you stay in feels tacked together, the shovel you hold is barely functional, the pistol you found has no magazine. All these sensations generated by the survival mechanics add to the horror element of Darkwood.

### The Beauty of Nature

Darkwood’s presentation is another one of its strong suits. The world is gloomy, bleak, and foreboding but the necessity to survive forces the player to strike out daily into the forest. When out in the forest, it can feel oppressive but with the gloom comes a beauty that I really be appreciated. The environments are rendered with such detail that one feels driven to explore every corner. In Darkwood, nature is consuming the society that once lived there, buildings are in ruin as trees burst through floorboards and mushrooms inhabit dark corners, but also the residents are being altered. The design and art for all the characters you come across in Darkwood are stunning. They are represented by beautifully grotesque pieces of art that have been given slight touches of animation putting the player at bit of unease. Overall, Darkwood is visually stunning and unlike any other piece of media I have experienced.

### Very Loose Handholding

The story for the player character in Darkwood is pretty straight forward, find a way to leave the forest. The way the player progresses is through exploration of different zones, trying to find hints on what you need or where to go next. The direction given by the game is very loose, just the journal your player character occasionally jots in holds any information that can point you in a general direction. I love this loose handholding; it allows the player to get wrapped up in the survival horror and forget what the point is. Sometimes I would play a couple in-game days and then realize I had just been surviving and not making any attempt to progress the story. This is a testament to the difficulty, game mechanics, and atmosphere but these lapses also add to the horror element. When you realize you just spent a couple days barely getting by but are also in no way closer to finding your way out, it is a sobering feeling.
