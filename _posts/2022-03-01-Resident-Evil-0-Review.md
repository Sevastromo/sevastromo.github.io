## 2021 Honorable Mention: Resident Evil 0

Two things hold 0 back from being a great resident evil game. 

First, it’s the infamous decision to not have item boxes… I love tight inventory management in RE games, but this goes too far and becomes very tedious. I not even against ditching the connected item boxes. Just give me standalone boxes at each typewriter so my inventory isn’t sprawled out all over the floor. 

Second is the mansion level. This level just feels like a cheap knockoff of original mansion and is where I lost interest in the game. To the games credit, the beginning train level is phenomenal and has some of the best pre-rendered backgrounds in the series. 

The two-character mechanic is fun enough and the controls are tight. Overall a decent entry into the series held back by a few annoying aspects.
