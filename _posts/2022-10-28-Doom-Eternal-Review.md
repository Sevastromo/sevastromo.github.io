### A Strategy Game but at Breakneck Speed
I really enjoy strategy games, often turn-based strategy games. Into the Breach, Battle Brothers, Slay the Spire, make up some of my all-time favorites. These games give you an infinite amount of time for analysis between every one of your moves. It’s slow, methodical, and challenging as you think through options and way the pros and cons. Now what if you removed the turn-based mechanic, so now the game no longer pauses, and kept the plethora of strategic gameplay options while throwing decisions at the player faster than they can handle? I think you get Doom Eternal… it’s a strategy game at breakneck speed.

I am not well-versed in what I’m going to call action FPS games. I’ve played classic Id Software titles like Doom, Quake, and Wolfenstein and the Half-Life and Halo series are some my favorites from the 2000s. That being said, I’ve found action FPS games to be fun but lacking in depth. They’re mechanically engaging often because of the slick movement and gunplay but as the novelty wears the repetitiveness comes out. The Id Software games then rely on tight, maze-like level design for quick bite-sized flurries of action, while Half-Life and Halo have more expansive, lived-in levels to explore. All of this is to say Doom Eternal is this but more. Slick movement and gunplay, expansive and maze-like levels, it’s all there, but now there’s another gameplay pillar and that’s strategy.

Now I want to run through a gameplay scenario to illustrate the mechanical and strategic depth Eternal presents the player.

### Verdict

★★★★1/2

Doom Eternal is the best action FPS I’ve ever played, hands down. No other game has ever had me glued to the screen so intensely. Other games have drawn me in just as much but the pace at which Eternal operates leaves your eyelids completely peeled back and your eyeballs popping out, scraping across the screen trying to take in all the information presented. Seriously, it’s hard to describe the sensory experience the occurs during an Eternal arena fight, there’s nothing quite like it. And it really comes down to the layered strategic options: resource management, enemy weaknesses, navigating the arenas, weapon combos. So, while you’re trying to take in all the visual queues on screen, audio queues are also going off in the background, add on top of that your brain frantically trying to make the right decision or more likely scrambling to correct the mistake you just made. And while I’ve spent so much time gushing over the gameplay, I’ll quickly mention that everything else about Eternal is just top notch. The art and world design are just gorgeous and imaginative, soundtrack and sound design are mixed just right to convey information while revving up the intensity, and the performance is phenomenal, Id Software absolutely optimized the hell out of Eternal and what game could possibly benefit from that more?
