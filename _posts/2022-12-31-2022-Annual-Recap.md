## Top 10 Games Played in 2022

### 1. Doom Eternal

#### Verdict: 
Doom Eternal is the best action FPS I’ve ever played, hands down. No other game has ever had me glued to the screen so intensely. Other games have drawn me in just as much but the pace at which Eternal operates leaves your eyelids completely peeled back and your eyeballs popping out, scraping across the screen trying to take in all the information presented. Seriously, it’s hard to describe the sensory experience the occurs during an Eternal arena fight, there’s nothing quite like it. And it really comes down to the layered strategic options: resource management, enemy weaknesses, navigating the arenas, weapon combos. So, while you’re trying to take in all the visual queues on screen, audio queues are also going off in the background, add on top of that your brain frantically trying to make the right decision or more likely scrambling to correct the mistake you just made. And while I’ve spent so much time gushing over the gameplay, I’ll quickly mention that everything else about Eternal is just top notch. The art and world design are just gorgeous and imaginative, soundtrack and sound design are mixed just right to convey information while revving up the intensity, and the performance is phenomenal. Id Software absolutely optimized the hell out of Eternal and what game could possibly benefit from that more?

#### Why is Doom Eternal #1?
While I may have put way more time into the likes of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Elden Ring, and Hitman 3, Eternal was the first time I've experienced anything like it. I'll remember Eternal like I remember my first time playing a Souls game or a roguelike, it's not just the great gameplay, it's also the sensation of being in uncharted waters.

#### Verdict: 

#### Why is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly #2?
With S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it's all about the atmosphere and immersion and Anomaly doesn't change that. Anomaly is a modern marvel, a mod the upgrades the game engine and combines three cult classic games into one. No one needs an excuse to reenter the zone, but Anomaly is the perfect one.

### 8. Inside

Inside exists in a realm somewhere between games and film. When Inside presents the player with obstacles it slows down and the feel is very gamey. Whether that’s because there’s trail and error involved, and you’re repeatedly dying or because there’s a puzzle that you must resolve before proceeding. None of this is bad just average. I think Inside’s strength is when it flows like a scene in a film that’s shot in a single take. The Sam Mendes’ film 1917 came to mind. Not because of the setting but because of this flow. The camera goes on a journey with the main character as he traverses battlefields, countrysides, cities, and more. There’s a momentum and energy that this technique evokes that can be found throughout Inside. With video games that energy can be even more tactile as you can really engage with the aforementioned _little things_. Brushing aside cornstalks, sliding down roofs, careening through office complexes shattering windows and upturning all furniture in your path… it’s never felt more engaging.

#### Why is Inside #7?
